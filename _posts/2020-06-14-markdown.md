## Project Description

We proposes a model capable of editing facial expressions in existing human images using multi-modal conditioning that is text and facial landmarks. Facial landmarks refer to the localization of essential points on facial images. The most common set of facial landmarks comprising 68 points is adopted. These landmarks are used to adjust facial expressions, giving conditioning to the model. By using facial landmarks, more subtle facial expressions and emotions can be edited to generated human images. Text conditioning enables the adjustment of features such as eye color, hair color, and hairstyle to craft the user's desired image.

In order to achieve the goal, we suggest a method that uses DiT models and gives text and facial landmark conditioning. DiT models are typically designed for single embedding, while accommodating both text and facial landmark conditioning. We also present modifications to the model structure to enable the handling of sequential data.

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

### Blockquote without attribution

> Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae. **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.

## Tables

Tables arenâ€™t [part of the core Markdown spec](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), but Hugo supports supports them out-of-the-box.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
